         Open the Email message record, in the email named KVM VPS Login Information. <br>
         <br>
         If the IP is blocked when it is turned on, it can be changed once for free within 72 hours after purchase (no bill will be generated). <br>
         <br>
         Self-service IPv4 replacement: Go to the user backend, click on the VPS that needs to be replaced, there is a "Change IP" option on the left, click and follow the instructions. The system will generate a one-time bill of $3, and the system will automatically change the IP after payment. <br>
         Note: If a work order is in OPEN status, the button to change the IP is unavailable, and the work order must be closed first. <br>

             Just reply with the order number. Or you can apply a template:

             <br>
             Note: If you don't have a LET account, you can register one. When registering, you need to fill in the reason for registration (write in English, for example, to communicate and learn about VPS information). You need to verify your email address and <strong>wait for the LET administrator to review the registration information. After passing the review, you can use your account to reply normally</strong>. <br>
             <br>
             Note 1: If you bought a machine earlier that missed the doubling of traffic, you can try to use the renewed invoice number yourself (success is not guaranteed)<br>
             Note 2: Doubling processing takes time, it can take as little as one or two days, three to five days or more is normal. <br>
             <br>
             2. The traffic will be shut down in the month when the traffic is used up, and the traffic will be reset on the 1st of every month, Western Pacific Time. <br>

             1: Introduction to the computer room<br>
             RN is currently selling mainly CC computer rooms, MC computer rooms in the US district, and Strasbourg computer rooms in the French district<br>
             <br>
             CC computer room (full name ColoCrossing): San Jose, Seattle, New Jersey, Chicago, Dallas, etc., currently does not support IPV6. <strike>IPs are basically blacklisted by Google again, and verification will be skipped when searching</strike> (Updated on 2023.06.30: IPs are currently not verified by Google again. I don't know how long it will last)<br>
             <br>
             MC Computer Room (Full name: Multacom Corporation): Only DC02 in Los Angeles, IP will not jump to Google verification, <strong>There is also IPv6, work order applications can be issued (up to 100, 1~5 recommended)</strong><br>
             <br>
             Strasbourg computer room: Strasbourg computer room, located in France, Europe. RN's newly launched computer room currently has relatively sufficient resources and is not crowded, and the price is higher than that of CC and MC. Supports IPV6 and can issue work order applications (up to 100, 1 to 5 recommended). <br>

             <strong>Network test of each computer room</strong>Address: <a href="https://lg-lax02.racknerd.com/" target="_blank">https://lg-lax02.racknerd.com/</a> <br>
             <br>
             <font color="Magenta"><strong>Currently, it is generally recommended that Los Angeles DC02 be the first choice for the computer room. San Jose, which had a good network before, was overwhelmed for a while and is now a little better (don't choose San Jose for mobile). If you want to wear a condom, you can consider people. There are not many unpopular computer rooms. This is purely my current opinion, and ultimately you will choose based on your own needs and actual test results. </strong></font><br>

             Note: The problem of Google jumping verification in Fuqiang can be solved with the one-click script WARP:<br>

             2. Computer room migration<br>
             If multiple computer rooms are available at the time of purchase, you can issue a work order to apply for migration to the ones available at that time (usually this is a one-time migration opportunity, so be careful). If you buy it for a fixed computer room, it may cost $5. Some lower-priced plans (&lt;$10) are more difficult to migrate. In addition, it is difficult to move from other computer rooms to Los Angeles DC02 or it will cost $5 (there are success and failure cases, subject to the result of the work order). <br>
             For example, the meaning of the work order can be as follows: The line is not good, please change the computer room. Please help me migrate this VPS to XX<br>
             <br>
             Note: After migration, the IP will change, data will be lost, make a backup, and the doubled traffic may be lost. (Reply to the work order: I left a message in the Let forum before. The traffic has doubled to 2xT. Now the traffic has changed back to xT. Can I apply to adjust it back to 2xT?)<br>

             1. Change email<br>
             <strong>Currently, you can apply for a free change of email address through a work order. </strong><br>
             Before Black Friday, you could send a work order to apply for changing your email address for free, but during Black Friday, because too many people sent work orders to change your email address, you would be charged $8. Currently, if there are no Black Friday flash sale chickens in your account, you can change your email address for free. If your account has Black Friday flash sale chickens, you will be charged $8 to change your email address (the final result will be subject to the work order). <br>
             <br>
             2. push<br>
             <strong>A push costs $8, and a work order is issued for the push. </strong><br>
             The push fee is calculated on a per-view basis, not on a per-channel basis. For example, account A has 4 units, and if you want to push 2 of them to account B, you need to pay 8 dollars instead of 16 dollars. <br>
